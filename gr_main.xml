            <title>Preface</title>
            <p>This is an open source textbook on general relativity. It aims escpecially at reviewing the mathematics behind it very closely. The author thinks this is especially important as nowadays a lot of physical theories aimed at unifying general relativity and quantum field theory aim at discretizing the smooth concepts found in general relativity. Similarily, in numerical relativity smooth, continuous objects have to replaced by discrete objects. In each of the aforementioned cases, the replacements have to performed with full care and detailed understanding of the nature of the mathematical objects both in the smooth and discrete case.</p>

            <conclusion>
                <p>Often the latter topological space is assumed to be of a simple, well-known structure. This still allows the space <m>Y</m> to posses an interesting structure, since it only has to look locally like <m>Y</m>. The concept of a manifold lives from this idea that the local structure of the manifold is very well prescribed, but the locally more or less uninteresting parts can be attached in many ways, to form an interesting object.</p>
                <p>A topological manifold is a separable Hausdorff space <m>M</m> which is locally homeomorphic to <m>R^n</m>. </p>
